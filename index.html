  <p>My name is Michael Nguyen.</p>
  <p>This is really a test to see if github pages will finally work after all these tries. But if it does, I'll have this nice and long paragraph to check how the formatting looks, especially on mobile. I don't really have much to say anymore, but I still have to write a lot. Unfortunate circumstances call for extraordinary willpower.</p>
